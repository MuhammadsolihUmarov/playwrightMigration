# Playwright Migration

This guide documents the migration from our previous WebDriverIO-based test framework to [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). It covers updated setup steps, configuration changes, and the new project structure.

---

## Overview

- **Test Runner:** Replaced WebDriverIO + Mocha with Playwright's built-in test runner.
- **Selectors:** Updated to use Playwrightâ€™s native, resilient selectors (`getByText`, `getByRole`, `locator`, etc.).
- **Page Objects:** All page objects now extend a shared `BasePage` using Playwrightâ€™s `Page` API.
- **Utilities:** Helper functions like `getLastPathSegments` simplify tasks such as URL validation.
- **Test Structure:** Tests are written using `test()` and `expect()` from Playwright and are organized by suite (e.g., `smoke`).
